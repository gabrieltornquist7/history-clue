## ðŸŽ¨ Design Details

### Rarity Colors:
- **Common**: Gray (#9ca3af)
- **Rare**: Blue (#3b82f6)
- **Epic**: Purple (#a855f7)  
- **Legendary**: Gold (#eab308)

Each rarity has unique border colors and glow effects!

## ðŸ”® Future Expansion Ideas

The shop system is designed to be easily expandable. You can add:

1. **Map Themes** - Different visual styles for the map
2. **Pin Styles** - Custom pin designs (diamonds, stars, etc.)
3. **Profile Cosmetics** - Borders, backgrounds, avatars
4. **Power-ups** - Consumable items like:
   - Free clue unlock
   - Score multiplier (2x for one game)
   - Extra time for guesses
5. **Badges** - Purchasable achievement icons
6. **Emotes** - For live battles

## ðŸ“Š How to Add New Items

To add more items, use Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
INSERT INTO shop_items (id, name, description, category, price, rarity, sort_order) VALUES
  ('title_new_item', 'New Title Name', 'Cool description', 'title', 1500, 'epic', 11);
```

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

1. **User earns coins** by playing games (endless, daily, challenges)
2. **User visits shop** and browses items
3. **User purchases item** â†’ coins deducted, item added to inventory
4. **User equips title** â†’ appears on their profile (ready for future display)
5. **Title displays** wherever you choose to show it (profile, leaderboard, etc.)

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Display equipped titles** on:
   - Profile pages
   - Leaderboards
   - Challenge screens
   - Live battle lobbies

2. **Add more categories**:
   - Uncomment category tabs in Shop.js
   - Add items with new categories to database

3. **Limited-time offers**:
   - Add `available_until` column to shop_items
   - Show "Limited Time!" badge

4. **Daily deals**:
   - Random item at 50% off each day

5. **Gift system**:
   - Allow users to gift shop items to friends

## ðŸŽ‰ Your Shop is Live!

Users can now:
- Browse beautiful, rarity-tiered titles

The shop matches your game's dark + gold aesthetic perfectly! ðŸŒŸ
