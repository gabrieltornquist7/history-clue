## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Quick Smoke Test (5 minutes)

1. **Database Functions**
```sql
-- Test create_battle:
SELECT * FROM create_battle(auth.uid());
-- Should return battle_id and invite_code

-- Note the invite_code, then test join_battle:
SELECT * FROM join_battle('CODE_HERE', auth.uid());
-- Should return error (can't join own battle)
```

2. **UI Navigation**

-- Should return multiple policies for each table
```

### Test Security
```sql
-- Try to read another user's battle (should fail):
SELECT * FROM battles WHERE player1_id != auth.uid();
-- Should return empty (RLS blocks it)
```

---

## üìä Performance Check

### Database Query Times
```sql

-- idx_battle_rounds_status
```
