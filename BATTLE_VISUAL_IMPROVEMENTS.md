# Live Battle Visual & Pressure Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Visual Opponent Status Indicator
Added a new status box at the top of the right panel showing:
- **🤔 Thinking...** - Opponent hasn't submitted yet (gray)
- **⏱️ Submitted First!** - Opponent submitted before you (yellow/orange)
- **✅ Guess Submitted!** - Opponent has submitted their guess (green)

### 2. ✅ Timer Pressure Mechanic
When either player submits first:
- Timer automatically reduces to maximum 45 seconds for the other player
- Timer turns orange to indicate pressure
- Shows "⚡ Hurry! Opponent submitted!" message
- Broadcasts `first_guess` event to trigger timer reduction immediately

### 3. ✅ Real-time Opponent Detection
Enhanced polling system:
- Checks opponent completion status every 2 seconds
- Updates opponent status as soon as they submit
- Sets `oppGuess` state so UI updates immediately
- Shows green checkmark when opponent completes

### 4. ✅ Better Visual Feedback
**Timer Colors:**
- White: Normal time (>45s)
- Orange: Pressure time (30-45s when opponent submitted first)
- Red: Critical time (<30s)

**Status Messages:**
- "Your Turn" card shows current instructions
- Orange warning box appears when opponent submits first
- Progress bar shows "Waiting for opponent..." after you submit

### 5. ✅ Improved Logging
Added console logs to track:
- When first_guess event is broadcast
- When timer is reduced and by how much
- When opponent status is detected and updated
- Round completion status for both players

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: You Submit First
1. You submit → Your card shows "Waiting for opponent..."
2. Opponent sees: Timer drops to 45s, orange warning appears
3. Opponent's status shows "⏱️ Submitted First!" (you)
4. When opponent submits → Both see results

### Scenario 2: Opponent Submits First
1. Opponent submits → You see "⚡ Opponent submitted first!"
2. Your timer reduces to max 45 seconds
3. Timer turns orange with pressure message
4. Opponent status shows "✅ Guess Submitted!"
5. You submit → Both see results

### Scenario 3: Both Submit Close Together
1. First player sees "Waiting for opponent..." briefly
2. Second player sees opponent status immediately
3. Both see results as soon as both complete

## Testing

Open console and look for:
```
[Realtime] First guess submitted by: <player-id>
Opponent submitted first! Reducing timer to 45s max
Timer reduced from 120s to 45s
Opponent has completed! Updating UI...
```

## Visual Flow

```
Before Any Guess:
├── Opponent: 🤔 Thinking...
├── Timer: White (180s)
└── Status: "Your Turn"

After Opponent Submits First:
├── Opponent: ✅ Guess Submitted!
├── Timer: Orange (45s max) ⚡
└── Status: "⚡ Opponent submitted first!"

After You Submit:
├── Your Status: "Waiting for opponent..."
├── Progress Bar: Pulsing 70%
└── Opponent: Shows completion when done

Both Complete:
└── Results Modal Shows! 🎉
```
