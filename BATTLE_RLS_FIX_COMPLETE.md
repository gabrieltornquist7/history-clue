# Battle Mode RLS Fix - Complete

## Issue Identified
The battle mode errors were caused by **RLS policies blocking data access**, not by cache issues:

### Root Cause
- `battle_rounds` table had RLS enabled but no policies
- This blocked read access to round data
- `gameData.currentRound` was `null`/`undefined`
- Accessing `currentRound.p1_score` → `undefined`
- Calling `.toLocaleString()` on `undefined` → **ERROR**

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Battle Rounds RLS Policies ✅
```sql
-- Allow players to SELECT their battle rounds
CREATE POLICY "battle_rounds_select_policy" ON battle_rounds
FOR SELECT USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM battles
    WHERE battles.id = battle_rounds.battle_id
    AND (battles.player1 = auth.uid() OR battles.player2 = auth.uid())
  )
);

-- Allow player1 to INSERT new rounds
CREATE POLICY "battle_rounds_insert_policy" ON battle_rounds
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM battles
    WHERE battles.id = battle_rounds.battle_id
    AND battles.player1 = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Allow players to UPDATE their scores
CREATE POLICY "battle_rounds_update_policy" ON battle_rounds
FOR UPDATE USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM battles
    WHERE battles.id = battle_rounds.battle_id
    AND (battles.player1 = auth.uid() OR battles.player2 = auth.uid())
  )
);
```

### 2. Battles RLS Policies ✅
```sql
-- Allow players to SELECT their battles
CREATE POLICY "battles_select_policy" ON battles
FOR SELECT USING (
  player1 = auth.uid() OR player2 = auth.uid()
);

-- Allow users to INSERT battles
CREATE POLICY "battles_insert_policy" ON battles
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  player1 = auth.uid()
);

-- Allow players to UPDATE battles
CREATE POLICY "battles_update_policy" ON battles
FOR UPDATE USING (
  player1 = auth.uid() OR player2 = auth.uid()
);
```

## Verification

Check that RLS is properly configured:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('battles', 'battle_rounds');
```

Should return:
```
 tablename     | rowsecurity
---------------+-------------
 battles       | t
 battle_rounds | t
```

## Testing Steps

1. ✅ Refresh browser (hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. ✅ Try joining a battle
3. ✅ Check that puzzles load correctly
4. ✅ Verify no RLS 406 errors in console
5. ✅ Confirm scores update properly
